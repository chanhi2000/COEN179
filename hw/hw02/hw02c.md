How could you simply modify the recursion in our version of quicksort to allow the program to switch to a simpler routine, say, insertion sort, for subarrays of length below some cutoff value? Write such a program and experiment with the cutoff sizes 4, 8, and 16 for an array of 5000 to 10000 randomly generated floats to see what the effect on the number of comparisons might be.
