A sorting algorithm is called stable if it preserves the relative order of any two equal elements in its input.  That is, if $$a[i]=a[j]$$ with $$i<j$$ in the array before sorting, then the entry $$a[i]$$ will end up in the sorted array in a position before the one where $$a[j]$$ ends up, for any such pair $$(i,j)$$. Which of the sorting algorithms we considered are stable?  Why might stability be a good property of a sorting algorithm?
