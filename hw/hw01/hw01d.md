##2.1.5

**(a)** Prove formula (2.1) for the number of bits in the binary representation of a positive decimal integer.
$$
b=\left\lfloor\log_{2}{(n)}\right\rfloor+1
$$

**(b)** Prove the alternative formula for the number of bits in the binary representation of a positive integer n:
$$
b=\left\lceil\log_{2}{(n+1)}\right\rceil
$$

**(c)** What would be the analogous formulas for the number of decimal digits?

**(d)** Explain why, within the accepted analysis framework, it does not matter whether we use binary or decimal digits in measuring nâ€™s size.
