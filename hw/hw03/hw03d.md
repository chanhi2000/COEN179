According to the corollary of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, every polynomial
$$
p(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n−1}x^{n−1}+\cdots+a_0
$$

can be represented in the form
$$
p(x)=a_n(x−x_1)(x−x2_)\cdots(x−x_n)
$$

where $$x_1,\:x_2,\:\cdots,\:x_n$$ are the roots of the polynomial (generally, complex and not necessarily distinct).  Discuss which of the two representations is more convenient for each of the following operations:

**(a)** polynomial evaluation at a given point

**(b)** addition of two polynomials

**(c)** multiplication of two polynomials
