Suppose an array $$A$$ of $$2n$$ entries contain $$2$$ different entries for $$n$$ distinct values. (For example, if $$n=8$$, the contents might be $$\text{CDACABBD}$$).  If we define a transposition to be an instance of $$A[i]>A[j]$$ when $$i<j$$ (so duplicate pairs cannot form a transposition), then find the expected number of transpositions in the $$2n$$-entry array with $$n$$ duplicates (Assume any entry appears at any location in the array with equal probability).
