We saw in class that searching an unsorted array of n entries takes at most n com- parisons, but that using binary search on a sorted array takes at most the number of bits in the binary representation of n. Suppose that you are randomly searching for an array item that you know is there, and that all entries are searched with the same probability.

**(a)** Show that the expected number of comparisons to locate the entry using sequential search (that is, the average number of comparisons) is $$\tfrac{(n+1)}{2}$$. [So, the expected number of comparisons is roughly half of the worst-case number of comparisons.]

**(b)** Is the expected number of comparisons to locate the entry in the sorted array using binary search roughly half the number of bits used to represent $$n$$? If not $$\tfrac{1}{2}$$, state what the proportion of the expected number of comparisons to the worst-case number of comparisons roughly should be.
