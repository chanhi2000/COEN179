Suppose a sorted array of $$n$$ elements takes at most $$6$$ comparisons in binary search. What are the possible value of $$n$$? What is the smallest expected value for the average-case number of comparisons for such an array, assuming that the probability that the search key is in the array with probability $$p$$ and the key is euqally likely to appear anywhere in the array.
